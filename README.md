**READE ME**

**Overview**
* With this project, we opted to create a Simon game
* The idea was to create a visual representation of simon with four flashing colored squares using tkinter
* Users would then input onto the command line using 1, 2, 3, and 4 to represent the sqares
* Much like a real game of simon, the game would go on until the user messed up while keeping track of high scores
